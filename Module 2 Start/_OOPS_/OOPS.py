# OOPS - object oriented programming .
# Class
# Objects         - ' IMPORTANT '

#       Plan           -  Class

# no_doors,no_bedrooms,no_windows
# These are called data members.

# house 1(same plan)   -  Objects
# house 2(same plan)   -  Objects
# house 3(same plan)   -  Objects


#       Bird           -  Class

#  no_eyes,feathers,wings,legs
#  These are called data members.

# canfly(),layeggs() - Task it can do (" Member functions "/ " Methods ")

# Crow,Parrot,Pegion   - Object of this class Bird.


#      Vehicle               - Class

# colour,fuel capacity,mileage,wheels   - data members

# apply_breaks(),change_gear()          - Member functions/Methods

# car , bus, bike , jeap     - objects of class Vehicle .


#   IMPORTANT    -

# 1. Abstraction : Act of representing essential features
#    without including background details.
# ( Hiding background details )  support Data hiding.

# 2. Encapsulation : Wrapping up of data members and methods .
# 3. Inheritance : Inherit the properties of parent class.

    # eg :
    # Bird   - Class

    # no_eyes
    # feathers
    # legs
    # eat_Foods() - " Member functions "/ " Methods "

    # flying bird (sub class)              Non flying bird (sub class)
    # can_fly()                            # cannot_fly()

    # crow,parrot                          # penguin,ostrich
    # object of flying bird                # object of nonflying bird

# 4. Polymorphism : ability to exists in more than one form .
# eg : if we take + , * 2+3=5.
                   #  * hai+students = haistudents.
